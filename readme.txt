One combined social feed on your site displaying posts from Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

=== Description ===

Displaying social updates made fast & simple!

Searching for the best way to implement social posts into your website? Look no further! With Social Wall you can quickly implement social posts into a wall that fit the design of your website.

=== Why use Social Wall? ===

Create a combined feed of all your social media channels. Almost everyone uses multiple social media to post and share content too. But how do you display all this scattered data nicely on your site? By building a Social Wall of course! Get social posts from all your social media account and display them on one single Social Wall sorted on the post date.

This plugin is built to allow you to own your data. Yes, we use an external API to allow your WordPress website to fetch social posts. But every post it fetches is ONLY stored in the database of your WordPress installation. This makes displaying social posts on the fly extremely fast cause on run time there is no need to call an external API, all your social posts are already stored in your database! Also, any attached media from the social posts will be downloaded & stored in the WordPress media library ready to be displayed.

All the freedom you need to display the social posts in any way you want to. By default, this plugin does not come with a display method. It's up to you to implement & design the last step in the process. This allows you to write your own HTML and you don't need to work against the plugin the get what you want! Keep it simple stupid.
